# Absenteeism project 

```sh
Business Case Study: Employee Absenteeism
The database was created with records of absenteeism at work

The business Task:
The exercise will address Absenteeism at a company during work time.
```


```sh
Problem:
The problem is that the work environment of today is more:

* Competitive
* Managers set unachievable business goals
* have an elevated risk of becoming unemployed

This can be lead to an increase in pressure and stress of the employee. Those factors influence employee health, which is of course indesirable.
```


```sh
Purpose of the business exercise:
Explore whether a person presenting certain characteristics is expected to be away from work at some point in time or not.

We want to know for how many working hours any employee could be away from work based on information like:

How far they live from their workplace.
How many children and pets they have.
Do they have higher education?
```
